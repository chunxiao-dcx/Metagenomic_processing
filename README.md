# Metagenomic_processing
This pipeline was used for raw sequence quailty control, metagenome assembly, gene annotation based on Metagenomic raw sequencing data.
It was described in the following publication: Metagenomic analysis reveals indole signaling effect on bacteria community in activated sludge: quorum sensing inhibition and antibiotic resistance enrichment.
The raw metagenome reads are available in the Genome Sequence Archive (GSA) under the BioProject CRP003644.
